You are given a sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1. Find the transition point efficiently.
 The transition point is a point where "0"  is folowing  by "1" or "1" is following by "0".
Note that, if there is no "1" exists, print -1.
Note that, in case of all 1s print 0.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
C[] = {0,0,0,1,1}
Output: 3
Explanation: position 3 is 0 and next
one is 1, so answer is 3.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 4
C[] = {0,0,0,0}
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, there is no "1",so
the answer is -1.
